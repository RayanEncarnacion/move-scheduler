<h1>Move Scheduler</h1> 

This is an app created with React in which the user can schedule exercises and mark the location of the exercise on the map while a tooltip with the exercise details.

## How to use it?

1 - The user needs to allow the usage of his/her location to center the map on that exact position.
2 - A click on the map will trigger an exercise form to show in the screen.
3 - Fill all the inputs on the form to save the exercise.
4 - A list item will pop up on the screen with the exercise details and a marker with a permanent tooltip will appear on the position where the user clicked the map.

### How to delete the exercise item?

A click on the "x" icon on the exercise item will permanently delete the exercise and remove the marker from the map.
